# Encode Lessons in Structure

**Setup gate.** Unless `XSTACK READY` is already in context this session, first run `sh <this file's directory>/../setup-xstack/scripts/check-setup.sh` from the project root. On `XSTACK SETUP MISSING`, or when the script is missing, stop. Show its output, tell the user to run `/setup-xstack`, and run no other step of this skill.

If the lesson needs judgment and cannot be encoded, make the instruction more prominent and add an example of the failure mode.

**Corollary:** If the fix is structural, only use the structural fix. The instruction is the symptom.
