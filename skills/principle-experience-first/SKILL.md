# Experience First

**Setup gate.** Unless `XSTACK READY` is already in context this session, first run `sh <this file's directory>/../setup-xstack/scripts/check-setup.sh` from the project root. On `XSTACK SETUP MISSING`, or when the script is missing, stop. Show its output, tell the user to run `/setup-xstack`, and run no other step of this skill.

When implementation convenience conflicts with user delight, choose delight.

- Every feature, control, and option must be justified
- Ship less, ship better (polished experience with three features beats rough one with ten)
- Prototype before committing (design decisions are cheaper in throwaway HTML than production code)
- Get the details right (transitions, alignment, spacing, feedback, error states)
- Tighten the core loop (every feature should serve the central workflow or get out of the way)

The user is whoever consumes the work. For a UI that is the end user. For a library or an internal API it is the colleague who imports it. The engineer who maintains the code next is a user too. Weigh their experience the same way, and explain impact from their perspective.

Foundations should serve the experience. Foundational thinking governs the _sequence_ of work. This principle governs the _target_.
