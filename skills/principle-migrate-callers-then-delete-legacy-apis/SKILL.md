# Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs

**Setup gate.** Unless `XSTACK READY` is already in context this session, first run `sh <this file's directory>/../setup-xstack/scripts/check-setup.sh` from the project root. On `XSTACK SETUP MISSING`, or when the script is missing, stop. Show its output, tell the user to run `/setup-xstack`, and run no other step of this skill.

- Update tests to assert the new contract, and delete tests that only protect pre-refactor implementation details

**When this applies:**

- No external users depend on backward compatibility
- The project can absorb coordinated breaking changes
- The new API is part of a simplification or refactor initiative
